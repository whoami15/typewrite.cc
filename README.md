# [Typewrite](https://typewrite.cc)

Typewrite a hosted bring-your-own-email newsletter service for people who need a simplistic and privacy-first newsletter service.

The core application is made up of the following:
* A Laravel back-end running on PHP 8.1
* A minimal front-end powered by [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev)

The source-code for the project will always be open-source and free for others to contribute to, use or self-host.
